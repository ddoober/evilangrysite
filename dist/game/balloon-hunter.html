    use your arrow keys to aim the bow and space to charge up and fire an arrow. try your best to hit as many balloons as you can.

    this game is fucking ass and i cant win for the life of me. fullscreen also bugs the background because flash can't handle resizing lmao. you can see the background teleporting back to wrap around.
